  An aggregate function in the [colums] clause computes a value froma group of rows
  
  create table animals as
    select "dog" as kind, 4 as legs, 20 as weight union
    select "cat"        , 4        , 10           union
    select "ferret"     , 4        , 10           union
    select "parrot"     , 2        , 6            union
    select "penguin"    , 2        , 10           union
    select "t-rex"      , 2        , 12000;
    
  select max(legs) from animals;
  >4
  select sum(weight) from animals;
  >12056
  select max(legs-weight) + 5 from animals;
  >1
  select max(legs), min(weight) from animals;
  >4|6
  select min(legs), max(weight) from animals
    where kind <> "t-rex";
  >2|20
  select avg(legs) from animals;
  >3.0
  select count(distinct legs) from animals;
  >2
  select count(*) from animals;
  >6
  select sum(distinct legs) from animals;
  >12036
  
  An aggregate function also selects a row in the table, which may be meaningful
    
    select max(weight), kind from animals;
    >12000|t-rex
    select min(weight), kind from animals;
    >6|parrot
    
  Rows in a table can be grouped and aggregation is performed on each group
  
  select [columns] from [table] group by [expression] having [expression];
  
    select legs, max(weight) from animals group by legs;
    >legs|max(weight) 4|20 2|12000
    select legs from animals group by legs;
    >2
     4
    select legs, count(*) from animals group by legs;
    >2|3
     4|3
    select legs, weight from animals group by legs, weight;
    >2|6
     2|10
     2|1200
     4|10
     4|20
   
  A having clause filters the set of groups that are aggregated
  select weight/legs, count(*) from animals group by weight/legs having count(*)>1;
